Mitar: I heard that rent in the most expensive part.
Equipment 1.donations 2.hack it! (find the materials) 3. recycling etc.
for cloyne: Madeline from central is working with Alumni to get funding

Cailey: I heard that initial costs are high. But individuals bring equipment. Very scrapy, individuals coming together. We have to start from ground zero.

Mitar: good questions: maybe get corporate sponorships. necessity is the mother of creativity

Cailey: sometimes buisnesses will give equipement

Mitar. doesn't have to be technical. this is cheaper than techincal things (sewing)

Mitar: we have some of the materials for it
Cailey: good that people are into recycled art projects. lots of things in there to be reused
Gary: Free room and ewaste. I will contact central to get rid of stuff in there. Central level duty, clean out freepile. pls use useless stuff
it's a storage issue, use da stuff. contact Gary to take things, use as much stuff as possible. Ewaste is picked up frequently twice a month
we have a box of textile that needs to be picked up
Mitar: two piles, one for ewaste, one for hackerspace from cleaning of house
Cailey: assign people to work on different projects. work in teams, dark room, repurposing old poles. Let's be able to work on our own time
Drew: dark room is separate room? We should clean out first. That should be the first priority
Mathilda: What part is actually the hackerspace?
Mitar: main room is basically the spot. everything is the hackerspace. even band room. paint room too!
Cailey: Garden project is also going on. Inside metal gate. Main project: main space. Idea: white boards, moveable tables.
Any other ideas?
Mitar: but first we need to clean up. but keep in mind what you want to work on.
